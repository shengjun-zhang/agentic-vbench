# Rollout records

The old Codex, Claude, and metadata-less schema-invalid Gemini files have been
removed. They predated the final scorer and pinned isolated environment and cannot
be cited as qualification results.

For the clean pass, retain the unmodified harness trajectory first, run
`tools/scrub_trajectory.py` only if a release asset requires local-path or opaque
payload redaction, and publish the raw or deterministically scrubbed whole file as a
fork release asset. Record its URL and SHA256 in `../scores.md`; do not replace the
raw trajectory with a summary.

For user-operated Claude and Antigravity runs, use the wrappers under
`../manual-runs/`. Their generated `manual-run-summary.json` is metadata, not a
replacement for the raw Harbor ATIF trajectory. When an Antigravity bundle contains
an outer App workflow record, its manifest distinguishes that record from the inner
task-agent trace and records its scope and SHA256 explicitly.

Example deterministic scrub:

```bash
python3 tools/scrub_trajectory.py \
  --input /path/to/raw.jsonl \
  --output /path/to/release.jsonl \
  --replace-path "/Users/name=/home/agent"
```

The script sorts JSON object keys and emits one compact JSON object per line, so the
same input and replacement arguments reproduce the recorded digest.
