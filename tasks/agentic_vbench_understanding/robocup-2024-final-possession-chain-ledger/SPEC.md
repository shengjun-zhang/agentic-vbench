# Task Spec Card

```yaml
task: agentic_vbench_understanding/robocup-2024-final-possession-chain-ledger
cognitive_level: understanding

modalities_required:
  video: Individual kicks, team continuity, attack direction, zones, and chain endings require temporal analysis of the moving match footage.
  audio: not used; the selected public representation has no audio stream.

question: Starting after the first goal, reconstruct every maximal same-team live-play possession chain containing at least two distinct kicks.
output_schema: '{"chains": [{"half": 1|2, "team": "white|black", "kick_count": "integer 2..64", "zone_path": ["defensive|middle|attacking", "..."], "terminal": "turnover|stoppage|goal"}]}'

evidence:
  - First half after the opening goal; establishes the first qualifying chains and each team's initial attack direction.
  - Second-half opening after the teams change ends; establishes the reversed attack directions and later chains.
  - Final visible live-play phase at second-half 0:00; establishes that the last chain ends in a stoppage rather than the later post-live log score change.

ground_truth:
  source: Official RoboCup SSL referee and tracked-vision log for the 2024 final.
  tier: machine-truth
  verification: TIGERs kicked_ball events are filtered by official referee live-play segments; the visible 3:0 state at second-half 0:00 is cross-checked against the log; the later post-live 4:0 change is excluded; tracker jitter is merged by time, position, and persistence.

scorer:
  metric: Exact full-chain order-preserving one-to-one matches followed by exact event-level IoU (Jaccard).
  matching: A prediction earns credit only when half, team, kick_count, zone_path, and terminal all match. One reviewed zone-boundary chain accepts its explicitly stored alternate full zone_path.
  partial_credit: none; no field earns standalone or graded credit.
  denominator: IoU is exact_matches / (submitted_entries + ground_truth_entries - exact_matches); every submitted list entry remains in the submitted-entry count, including schema-invalid entries and duplicates.
  oracle_reward: 1.0
  null_reward: 0.0

difficulty:
  strong_agent_reward: exact IoU below 0.10 for each retained full-agent row
  tool_call_turns: Codex 64; Claude 416; Antigravity 145
  required_lineup: GPT-5.6 Sol; Fable 5 or Opus 4.8; Gemini 3.1 Pro or 3.5 Flash
  prior_runs: superseded because they predate the final scorer and were not run through the pinned isolated environment

anti_shortcut:
  single_frame: completed under the pinned Codex ablation protocol
  video_only: not applicable as a degradation because the full task input is video-only
  audio_only: not applicable because audio is absent
  no_media: completed under the pinned Codex ablation protocol
  ocr_only: completed under the pinned Codex ablation protocol
  frame_dump_no_tools: completed over all 44032 native frames with tools disabled

## Ground-truth population

The verifier contains 17 chains: seven in the first half and ten in the second;
ten belong to `white` and seven to `black`; twelve end in `turnover` and five in
`stoppage`. No accepted chain has a `goal` terminal under the task's post-first-goal,
video-aligned definition.

## OCR resistance

The overlay exposes the score and clock but not robot-ball launches, live-play
state, same-team continuity, team-relative field zones, or the event that ends a
chain. OCR can help navigate the match but cannot produce the scored ledger without
temporal gameplay analysis.

## Calibration qualification

The scorer, null/spam regressions, native-frame contact evidence, pinned base image,
exact ablation protocols, and retained qualification runs are complete. The old local
outputs are not claimed as qualification because they predate the final scorer and
isolated environment. Results and whole-file trajectory digests belong in
`calibration/scores.md`.

## Contact observability

Four sequences of consecutive native 720p50 frames cover both halves and show ball
approach, contact occlusion, direction reversal, and free-flight separation. They are
checked in under `calibration/contact-evidence/` with a digest-checking generator.
This evidence directly audits the perception primitive used by every ground-truth
chain; it is reviewer evidence and is not available to the agent.
